# **Programming II - Python Projects**

This repository contains Python projects developed during my **Programming II** course. The projects focus on text processing, data analysis, image manipulation, and graph-based problem-solving using Python and various libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and NetworkX.

## **Projects Overview**:

### **1. Text and Data Processing (TPC1)**
- **Objective**: Implement text processing functions to manipulate and analyze chapters and paragraphs from text files.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Organizing paragraphs by chapters.
  - Finding the smallest chapter based on size.
  - Identifying dialogues and counting character mentions.
  - Roman numeral processing and DNA sequence analysis.
- **Libraries**: Regular expressions, os, re.

### **2. Image Manipulation and Data Analysis (TPC2)**
- **Objective**: Perform image processing and data analysis tasks using real-world datasets.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Converting images from RGB to grayscale and black-and-white.
  - Analyzing historical Nobel Prize data.
  - Working with election data and performing calculations like abstention rates.
  - Plotting recycling data for different countries.
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Pillow (PIL), NetworkX, Matplotlib.

### **3. Advanced Data Visualization and L-Systems (TPC3)**
- **Objective**: Visualize fractal-like structures and perform spatial data analysis with GeoPandas.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Implementing and visualizing L-systems (Lindenmayer systems) using turtle graphics.
  - Geospatial analysis of housing data and plotting maps of urban areas.
  - Modeling ecological systems using directed graphs and visualizing species interactions.
- **Libraries**: GeoPandas, Contextily, Shapely, Matplotlib, NetworkX, SciPy.

## **Features**:
- **Text Processing**: Functions to analyze and manipulate text, identify chapters, count character mentions, and process DNA sequences.
- **Image Manipulation**: Convert images to grayscale, black-and-white, and perform contour detection.
- **Data Analysis**: Work with real-world datasets, including Nobel laureates and recycling data.
- **L-Systems Visualization**: Generate and plot fractal structures using turtle graphics.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Analyze housing and neighborhood data using geospatial plotting techniques.
